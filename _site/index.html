                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <h3>Code for America and Vallejo's mission</h3>
                <p>Our city partner expressed several concerns about strained relations between Vallejo residents and the city’s police department. On the one hand, our city partner cited a string of officer-involved shootings in 2011 and 2012 that spurred protests at City Council meetings and were the subject of a recent long-form article published in Buzzfeed, a news media company with a large national readership. On the other hand, he also worried that residents were unsatisfied with the police department’s limited resources to investigate property crimes. Since the City of Vallejo filed for bankruptcy in 2009, police staffing levels lowered and property crimes rose. Communities have become increasingly organized through neighborhood watch organizations to address needs for safety that the City has been unable to meet. </p>

                <p><b>Increase trust between the police department and the community.</b></p>

                <p>More specifically, our city partner suggested that we might be able to work toward this goal by involving clergy, youth, and neighborhood watch group members in our process. He also expressed a desire for improved internal processes, proactive engagement, and data analytics.</p>

                <h3>How we set out to accomplish goals</h3>
                <p>Unlike other civic technology projects that seek to streamline a narrowly defined technical issue within a particular governmental process, our project was both far more open and far more personal. Therefore, we decided to dedicate two months toward relationship building, community outreach and field research before building.  we decided that the more voices that we could incorporate into the design of this project, the greater likelihood that we would be able to meet our city partner’s objective of increasing trusting relationships between community members and law enforcement. We also realized that the only way we were going to be able to find a way to “increase trust” was by partnering with those in the police department as well as those living and working in Vallejo to hear their perspectives and witnessing their interactions first hand, on the ground.</p>

                <p>We realized that the only way we were going to be able to find a way to “increase trust” was by partnering with those in the police department as well as those living and working in Vallejo to hear their perspectives and witnessing their interactions first hand, on the ground.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>To do this, we set up shadowing sessions with the police department to get a first hand look at where residents and police have interactions everyday, when calling 911 or seeking assistance from the police department and city personnel, like Code Enforcement and the Community Services Section of the police department. </p>

                <p>We also sat with many different residents and listened to their stories detailing their experiences, relationships, and thoughts of the policing and safety in Vallejo. Many of them also expressed their perception of the national conversation on policing and community relations and how it relates to safety and justice in their city. </p>

                <h2>Research Insights</h2>

                <h3>Vallejo’s unique pride and hope in their city</h3>

                <p>Despite the rocky history that Vallejo has been through, the city still has a lot of pride and hope in the success of Vallejo.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Belief that Vallejo is finally in a position for success</p>
                <p class="description">“Phoenix rising from the ashes” was the phrase many resident’s used to describe their feelings about Vallejo, a city bankrupt and once defeated, now finally growing more stable and prosperous. We noticed an overwhelming sense of pride and ownership of the city from citizens. They acknowledged Vallejo’s turbulent history and stability while still believing Vallejo is finally in a position to be successful. Many spoke of Vallejo having the potential to be one of the best cities in the Bay Area due to its prime location, great weather, and new leadership.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Vallejo is the best city in the Bay area, we’re a phoenix rising from the ashes.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Strong hope in Vallejo’s new leadership</p>
                <p class="description">Vallejo has had a history of leaders, both in the City Manager’s office as well as the police department, coming for a short period of time, resulting in an unstable leadership presence in the city during fragile times. While we were in the field, residents and city staff often mentioned that part of their belief in Vallejo’s soon to come success was due to finally having stable leaders where the city needs them most. Chief Bidou of the police department was mentioned as a progressive, young, and savvy new leader that people have faith in, due to his success in Benicia. Dan King, the City Manager, was also mentioned for being one of the first city managers in awhile who represent the city’s more stable future.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Community coming together to take care of themselves </p>
                <p class="description">After the bankruptcy and the cutting of resources in the police department, the number of Neighborhood Watch groups in Vallejo rose dramatically from # to over 200 in 2013. This is believed to be due to the rise in crime and the need for neighborhoods to start to take care of themselves, since there were not enough officers to man the whole city. We attended many neighborhood watch meetings during our research, all of them working very hard together to look out for one another  and work with the police department to learn strategies to keep their neighborhoods safe.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>You guys are more powerful than the whole city combined. Come together and use it. - Neighborhood watch leader</p>
                </blockquote>



                <h3>Sources of community distrust in the police department </h3>

                <p>Although there are many who are hopeful, we did meet people in the Vallejo  community who expressed distrust in the police department. By coding and mapping out the themes and patterns in observations and interviews from our field research, we were able to identify some insights that identify a few sources of that distrust.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Lack of faith in the police department’s ability to fulfill expectations held of them</p>
                <p class="description">Some residents feel the police department cannot help them when they really need it. Anecdotes of calling the police for help and having to wait a very long time, even up to 4 or 5 hours, for them to arrive were very commonly told during our research. They acknowledge the bankruptcy and many told stories of speaking to officers who have told them that there just isn’t enough officers to respond quickly to every call. Living in higher crime areas and not feeling that they can rely on help makes residents feel desensitized and apathetic to calling the police for help at all.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>It took them 4 hours to get here. It was like they’d given up before they even started.</p>
                </blockquote>

While we were in the field, residents and city staff often mentioned that part of their belief in Vallejo’s soon to come success was due to finally having stable leaders where the city needs them most. Chief Bidou of the police department was mentioned as a progressive, young, and savvy new leader that people have faith in, due to his success in Benicia. Dan King, the City Manager, was also mentioned for being one of the first city managers in awhile who represent the city’s more stable future.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Lack of empathy received from officers they have interacted with</p>
                <p class="description">They feel the police officers who have direct contact with citizens do not care about them and their situations. Mentions of dispatchers and patrol officers not being sincere or endearing when they do finally respond to resident’s 911 calls were prominent during our research. In neighborhood watch meetings, often a police dispatcher would talk with attendees about why dispatchers may come off as rude when answering a 911 phone call. Residents we spoke to mentioned sometimes feeling like a burden for calling the police for help, especially when police arrive and give explanations about being understaffed and overworked.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>I felt like I was a burden for even calling.. like, I’m sorry my house got broken into and you had to come deal with it.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Fear of police being unpredictable and not knowing who’s going to be accountable.</p>
                <p class="description">Specifically from minority groups, they feel the patrol officers are unpredictable and can be a threat to the people they’re trying to help. One resident told us he would not call the police if two African American males were having a dispute because he thinks the police might make it worse and hurt someone. Citizens were also confused about how to hold a police officer accountable if something did go wrong. The lack of transparency and unpredictability in having an interaction with a police officer leads some residents to do their best to avoid any interactions with them at all.</p>


                <h3>Sources of police resignation in the community</h3>

                <p>The police are acknowledging of the distrust that some residents and groups have in them and openly speak about wanting to change that and work to make their relationships better. However, in our research we noticed the police have some resignations and frustrations in the community that may prevent them from being able to truly open up. Here are a few sources of that resignation:</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community doesn’t understand the realities of police work </p>
                <p class="description">Because they think the community doesn’t understand their situation, they often discredit  certain reports and complaints from citizens as a “lack of education” in the community. Patrol officers we spoke to mention feeling that their fellow officers are the only ones who really know what it’s like to be in their shoes, and that they wish residents were more empathetic of what they experience in the line of duty everyday. Many of the police department’s community engagement efforts have the goal of educating the community on what police can and cannot handle and getting citizens to understand what it’s like to be a police officer.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>We need to educate the community on what the police can and cannot do.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community doesn’t personally know the officers so they make assumptions about them</p>
                <p class="description">Officers were generally frustrated that they get compared to other police officers and departments who have recently gained a lot of negative national attention in the past couple years. They believe that if Vallejo community members  just spent more time with Vallejo police officers and got to see that they are not bad people, then the community would trust them more. Along with educating the public, many of the police’s community programs are focused on literally just spending time with officers and getting to know them. </p>

                <p class="section-lead">Feeling the community relies too heavily on the police for everything</p>
                <p class="description">Police mention that the community needs more education on what police officers are actually supposed to respond to, and what are smaller issues that the community really should be handling themselves. They often try to get the community to work together to solve some of their own problems, instead of asking the police to deal with everything. For example, at neighborhood watch meetings officers talk to attendees on how to keep their neighborhoods safe and on the importance of knowing your neighbors and looking out for each other. When calls for service come in that officers believe they shouldn’t be handling, they express frustration with the community for not understanding how to take care of themselves, at least for the smaller things. The more the police officers feel that it shouldn’t be their problem to deal with, the more averse they are to responding to the call for service.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community will not receive them openly, or doesn’t really want their help</p>
                <p class="description">When observing officers at community events, we noticed they often congregate together, separate from the rest of the attendees. When talking to police about their thoughts on community relationships, they mentioned feeling that certain communities and residents didn’t always want their help or that they weren’t always welcomed when they did try to reach out and give help. For example, when one police officer responded to the shooting of a 7 year old, he retold the story of feeling very discouraged when entering the neighborhood to investigate and having people shouting for the police to go home and that they didn’t want the police there because they didn’t trust them. Years of negative history in Vallejo as well as nationally make it very hard for the police and certain communities to receive each other openly and work together, even in the more dire circumstances. Consequently, some officers feel discouraged that they’ll ever be accepted or able to build relationships with the people that they want to help.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>It was like the walk of shame, having to get out and walk around a neighborhood where you feel like no one wants you there.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This report details our work in Vallejo from January until now, mid-June. We’ve lived in Vallejo, done research with residents and police, identified where distrust lies and named goals that we think can help make steps in the direction towards a better relationship between both parties, and now have three projects that we’re working to build and launch by November. Through our build, testing, and refining cycles, any one of these projects may change based on things we will continue to learn from Vallejo residents and police.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Building, testing, and refining the thing</p>
                <p class="description">We’ll be working on developing our projects on the web, testing it with the people who will be using it once it’s build, and refining each project based on the things we learn in these cycles.</p>
