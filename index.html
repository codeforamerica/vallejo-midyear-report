                <h3>Code for America and Vallejo's mission</h3>

                <p><i>“Engage residents to improve the public safety . . . and transform the relationship between the community and the police department.”</i></p>

                <p><div align="right"> -- Dan Keen, City Manager</div align="right"></p>

                <p>Our city partner expressed several concerns about strained relations between Vallejo residents and the city’s police department. On the one hand, our city partner cited the <a href= "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/11/27/colleague-describes-killing-of-vallejo-police-officer-in-2011-bank-robbery/">2011 death of an officer in the line of duty,</a> and<a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20121230/top-stories-of-2012-officer-involved-shootings-prompt-ongoing-debate"> 6 civilian fatalities at the hands of officers in 2012</a> that spurred protests at City Council meetings (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlpNmeafJ7Q">the most recent on May 7, 2015</a>). These incidents, though years old, were the subject of a recent <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/three-shootings-in-vallejo">long-form article published in Buzzfeed</a>, a news media company with a large national readership.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, he also worried that residents were unsatisfied with the police department’s limited resources to investigate property crimes. Since the City of Vallejo filed for bankruptcy in 2009, police staffing levels lowered and property crimes rose. <a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20150110/vallejo-neighborhood-takes-stand-against-crime">Communities have become increasingly organized through neighborhood watch organizations</a> to address needs for safety that the City has been unable to meet. The landscape into which we entered was complex in that there were may reasons for distrust in Vallejo.

                <p>Our city partner suggested that we might be able to work toward this goal by involving clergy, youth, and neighborhood watch group members in our process. He also expressed a desire for improved internal processes, proactive engagement, and data analytics.</p>

                <h2>Strategy</h2>

                <h3>How we will accomplish the project goals</h3>
                <p>Unlike other civic technology projects that seek to streamline a narrowly defined technical issue within a particular governmental process, our project was both far more open and far more personal. Therefore, we decided to dedicate two months toward relationship building, community outreach and field research before building.  we decided that the more voices that we could incorporate into the design of this project, the greater likelihood that we would be able to meet our city partner’s objective of increasing trusting relationships between community members and law enforcement.</p>

                <p>We realized that the only way we were going to be able to find a way to “increase trust” was by partnering with those in the police department as well as those living and working in Vallejo to hear their perspectives and witnessing their interactions first hand, on the ground.</p>

                <p>To do this, we set up shadowing sessions with the police department to get a first hand look at where residents and police have interactions everyday, when calling 911 or seeking assistance from the police department and city personnel, like Code Enforcement and the Community Services Section of the police department.</p>

                <ul class="bricks bricks-4">

                </ul>

                <p>We also sat with many different residents and listened to their stories detailing their experiences, relationships, and thoughts of the policing and safety in Vallejo. Many of them also expressed their perception of the national conversation on policing and community relations and how it relates to safety and justice in their city.</p>

                <h2>Research Insights</h2>

                <h3>Vallejo’s unique pride and hope in their city</h3>

                <p>Despite the rocky history that Vallejo has been through, the city still has a lot of pride and hope in the success of Vallejo.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Belief that Vallejo is finally in a position for success</p>
                <p class="description">“Phoenix rising from the ashes” was the phrase many resident’s used to describe their feelings about Vallejo, a city bankrupt and once defeated, now finally growing more stable and prosperous. We noticed an overwhelming sense of pride and ownership of the city from citizens. They acknowledged Vallejo’s turbulent history and stability while still believing Vallejo is finally in a position to be successful. Many spoke of Vallejo having the potential to be one of the best cities in the Bay Area due to its prime location, great weather, and new leadership.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Vallejo is the best city in the Bay area, we’re a phoenix rising from the ashes.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Strong hope in Vallejo’s new leadership</p>
                <p class="description">Vallejo has had a history of leaders, both in the City Manager’s office as well as the police department, coming for a short period of time, resulting in an unstable leadership presence in the city during fragile times. While we were in the field, residents and city staff often mentioned that part of their belief in Vallejo’s soon to come success was due to finally having stable leaders where the city needs them most. Chief Bidou of the police department was mentioned as a progressive, young, and savvy new leader that people have faith in, due to his success in Benicia. Dan King, the City Manager, was also mentioned for being one of the first city managers in awhile who represent the city’s more stable future.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Community coming together to take care of themselves </p>
                <p class="description">After the bankruptcy and the cutting of resources in the police department, the number of Neighborhood Watch groups in Vallejo rose dramatically from # to over 200 in 2013. This is believed to be due to the rise in crime and the need for neighborhoods to start to take care of themselves, since there were not enough officers to man the whole city. We attended many neighborhood watch meetings during our research, all of them working very hard together to look out for one another  and work with the police department to learn strategies to keep their neighborhoods safe.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>You guys are more powerful than the whole city combined. Come together and use it. - Neighborhood watch leader</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Sources of community distrust in the police department </h3>

                <p>Although there are many who are hopeful, we did meet people in the Vallejo  community who expressed distrust in the police department. By coding and mapping out the themes and patterns in observations and interviews from our field research, we were able to identify some insights that identify a few sources of that distrust.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Lack of faith in the police department’s ability to fulfill expectations held of them</p>
                <p class="description">Some residents feel the police department cannot help them when they really need it. Anecdotes of calling the police for help and having to wait a very long time, even up to 4 or 5 hours, for them to arrive were very commonly told during our research. They acknowledge the bankruptcy and many told stories of speaking to officers who have told them that there just isn’t enough officers to respond quickly to every call. Living in higher crime areas and not feeling that they can rely on help makes residents feel desensitized and apathetic to calling the police for help at all.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>It took them 4 hours to get here. It was like they’d given up before they even started.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="description">They feel the police officers who have direct contact with citizens do not care about them and their situations. Mentions of dispatchers and patrol officers not being sincere or endearing when they do finally respond to resident’s 911 calls were prominent during our research. In neighborhood watch meetings, often a police dispatcher would talk with attendees about why dispatchers may come off as rude when answering a 911 phone call. Residents we spoke to mentioned sometimes feeling like a burden for calling the police for help, especially when police arrive and give explanations about being understaffed and overworked.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>I felt like I was a burden for even calling.. like, I’m sorry my house got broken into and you had to come deal with it.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Fear of police being unpredictable and not knowing who’s going to be accountable.</p>
                <p class="description">Specifically from minority groups, they feel the patrol officers are unpredictable and can be a threat to the people they’re trying to help. One resident told us he would not call the police if two African American males were having a dispute because he thinks the police might make it worse and hurt someone. Citizens were also confused about how to hold a police officer accountable if something did go wrong. The lack of transparency and unpredictability in having an interaction with a police officer leads some residents to do their best to avoid any interactions with them at all.</p>


                <h3>Sources of police resignation in the community</h3>

                <p>The police are acknowledging of the distrust that some residents and groups have in them and openly speak about wanting to change that and work to make their relationships better. However, in our research we noticed the police have some resignations and frustrations in the community that may prevent them from being able to truly open up. Here are a few sources of that resignation:</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community doesn’t understand the realities of police work </p>
                <p class="description">Because they think the community doesn’t understand their situation, they often discredit  certain reports and complaints from citizens as a “lack of education” in the community. Patrol officers we spoke to mention feeling that their fellow officers are the only ones who really know what it’s like to be in their shoes, and that they wish residents were more empathetic of what they experience in the line of duty everyday. Many of the police department’s community engagement efforts have the goal of educating the community on what police can and cannot handle and getting citizens to understand what it’s like to be a police officer.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>We need to educate the community on what the police can and cannot do.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community doesn’t personally know the officers so they make assumptions about them</p>
                <p class="description">Officers were generally frustrated that they get compared to other police officers and departments who have recently gained a lot of negative national attention in the past couple years. They believe that if Vallejo community members  just spent more time with Vallejo police officers and got to see that they are not bad people, then the community would trust them more. Along with educating the public, many of the police’s community programs are focused on literally just spending time with officers and getting to know them. </p>

                <p class="section-lead">Feeling the community relies too heavily on the police for everything</p>
                <p class="description">Police mention that the community needs more education on what police officers are actually supposed to respond to, and what are smaller issues that the community really should be handling themselves. They often try to get the community to work together to solve some of their own problems, instead of asking the police to deal with everything. For example, at neighborhood watch meetings officers talk to attendees on how to keep their neighborhoods safe and on the importance of knowing your neighbors and looking out for each other. When calls for service come in that officers believe they shouldn’t be handling, they express frustration with the community for not understanding how to take care of themselves, at least for the smaller things. The more the police officers feel that it shouldn’t be their problem to deal with, the more averse they are to responding to the call for service.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community will not receive them openly, or doesn’t really want their help</p>
                <p class="description">When observing officers at community events, we noticed they often congregate together, separate from the rest of the attendees. When talking to police about their thoughts on community relationships, they mentioned feeling that certain communities and residents didn’t always want their help or that they weren’t always welcomed when they did try to reach out and give help. For example, when one police officer responded to the shooting of a 7 year old, he retold the story of feeling very discouraged when entering the neighborhood to investigate and having people shouting for the police to go home and that they didn’t want the police there because they didn’t trust them. Years of negative history in Vallejo as well as nationally make it very hard for the police and certain communities to receive each other openly and work together, even in the more dire circumstances. Consequently, some officers feel discouraged that they’ll ever be accepted or able to build relationships with the people that they want to help.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>It was like the walk of shame, having to get out and walk around a neighborhood where you feel like no one wants you there.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Prototypes</h2>

                <p>TODO: add images</p>

                <h3>911 ETA Tracker</h3>
                <p>What if a resident could track their 911 call and see how long they had until an officer was going to arrive at their house? From the numerous reports of frustration around wait times after calling 911 in Vallejo, we thought maybe at least knowing how long it would take would make residents feel the police were more reliable and trustworthy, because they weren’t leaving residents in the dark, not knowing when they were going to receive help.</p>

                <p>What we learned: After taking this idea to residents in the community to see how valuable this would be to them, we realized that many residents felt that they should either receive help right away or if it was a low emergency issue, they were okay with waiting up to 1 hour for help. After getting this feedback, we looked into average response times for low priority calls with Vallejo police department and found that there were only few instances of long wait times. For these reasons, we decided to focus our efforts on other possible projects that might show higher need.</p>

                <h3>Community Dashboard</h3>
                <p>What if the community could be updated regularly with information on recently police activity and new information? From our first round of research, we identified that there is a need for more clear and transparent information in police activity that we hypothesized would increase community trust in the department because they would feel that they were more open and they know what’s going on. To test the value of this idea, we sat with residents and did a card sort with them, asking them to sort cards of police data they would find useful or interesting. Then we talked with them about how they might use this in their everyday lives.</p>

                <p>What we learned: Different people want different information depending on the community they most relate to, their goals, and their own personal experiences. We kept all the insights that we gained from this prototype and used it to inform the projects we’re moving forward with today.</p>

                <h3>Police Management Dashboard</h3>
                <p>From the RMS data we were given access to, we made a couple prototypes of potential graphs and analysis that officers could use to inform their strategic decisions. For example, we were able to visualize an officer’s shift and see which calls had longer response times than others, where they drove during their shift, and how call volume fluctuates during a shift.</p>

                <p>What we learned: After putting these prototypes in front of the police department, they expressed that their main priority was community engagement, lowering crime, and finding more resources for staffing. We decided to find a project that better fit those needs.</p>

                <h2>Project Definition</h2>

                <p>TODO: add images</p>

                <h3>The ideas we're moving forward with</h3>
                <p><b>1. A tool to identify systemic quality of life issues in neighborhoods and mobilize residents and the police department to take action where problems start.</b></p>

                </p>While shadowing the Community Services Section(CSS) of the police department, who deal with reports of quality of life issues and nuisance properties in resident’s neighborhoods, we witnessed them spending copious amounts of time during intake. They receive about 200 calls to their voicemail inbox a week and write them down on a paper notepad in between service calls. We realized this process could be more efficiently handled through technology.</p>

                <p>Additionally, we noticed that often they’re dealing with problems after they’ve already happened in neighborhoods, but what if we could help target the source of the problem? We’re now looking into not only making the reporting process less tedious, but also in gathering information on targeting the issues where they begin, when property owners neglect their properties and leave their houses open for causing nuisance and safety issues in neighborhoods.</p>

                <p>By providing tools that help police and residents work together to target the source of the problems, residents might feel a stronger sense of trust in the police’s ability to help them prevent problems before they happen.</p>

                <p><b>2. A tool that helps the police department stay coordinated, see where they can strategize their efforts, and send crime prevention strategies to residents whose neighborhood shows higher calls for service.</b></p>

                <p>We sat along with dispatchers in the police department many times in the past 6 months and noticed that they suffer from mapping constraints with the technology they are currently using. This makes it hard to coordinate information between patrol officers on the ground, slowing down their ability to respond to and help residents in need.</p>

                <p>We also have access to tons of rich data collected through the police’s RMS system, every time a residents calls in to 911 or an officer inputs information into their computer in the field. We want to use this information to help officers coordinate between each other, and analyze trends in neighborhoods where residents might be in greater need for crime prevention strategies.</p>

                <p><b>3. A tool that provides a central place for residents to go when they need to know what to do when the police may not directly be able or available to help them.</b></p>

                <p>A common theme throughout our work with Vallejo residence this year was the lack of useful information on what to do when they need help or where to go to find resources. We observed countless citizens visiting the front lobby of the police department just to ask a question and reports of residents not taking action on something that was important to them, simply because they didn’t know where to start.</p>

                <p>We are now working on building a central place where residents can go online, ask a question, and find clear and straightforward answers to those questions. Police officers and other community members will be able to contribute to answers and keep a dialogue going about the biggest needs in the community. We want to make it a collaborative tool where the police department and the community can all work together to make sure everyone is always informed.</p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <h3>The rest of the fellowship and beyond</h3>

                <p>This report details our work in Vallejo from January until now, mid-June. We’ve lived in Vallejo, done research with residents and police, identified where distrust lies and named goals that we think can help make steps in the direction towards a better relationship between both parties, and now have three projects that we’re working to build and launch by November. Through our build, testing, and refining cycles, any one of these projects may change based on things we will continue to learn from Vallejo residents and police. Here is what the rest of the year will look like:</p>

                <img src="/assets/timeline.png">

                <p class="section-lead">Building, testing, and refining the thing</p>
                <p class="description">We’ll be working on developing our projects on the web, testing it with the people who will be using it once it’s build, and refining each project based on the things we learn in these cycles.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Getting people to use these projects out in the world</p>
                <p class="description">We’ll be making sure the community and police know about the projects that we built and will be working with them to make sure it fits their needs and is practical to use in their everyday lives.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Getting the projects to last beyond our fellowship year</p>
                <p class="description">These project extend beyond our fellowship year, and we will be working with the city to make sure it’s maintained and sustainable even when we are no longer working in Vallejo.</p>
