                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

                <p><b>We're building tools that will support more trusting relationships between police and city residents</b></p>

                <p>The City of Vallejo asked Code for America fellows to help them "increas[e] trust between the police department and residents," particularly by involving clergy, youth, and neighborhood watch group members in our process. The City Manager, Dan Keen, expressed that he hoped for us to build digital tools that would produce improved internal processes, proactive engagement, and data analytics.</p>

                <p>We initially focused our first few months on learning from people living and working in Vallejo (with the understanding that trust is built by people, not mobile apps nor websites). After over 53 hours of interviews with residents, 18 shadowing sessions with the police department, and review of 120 database tables with city records, we saw opportunity to help the city by building tools that would improve communication, efficiency, and the community's ability to access information.</p>

                <h3>Code for America and Vallejo's mission</h3>

                <p><i>"Engage residents to improve the public safety... and transform the relationship between the community and the police department."</i></p>

                <p><div align="right"> -- Dan Keen, City Manager</div align="right"></p>

                <p>Our city partner expressed several concerns about strained relations between Vallejo residents and the city’s police department. On the one hand, our city partner cited the <a href= "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/11/27/colleague-describes-killing-of-vallejo-police-officer-in-2011-bank-robbery/">2011 death of an officer in the line of duty,</a> and<a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20121230/top-stories-of-2012-officer-involved-shootings-prompt-ongoing-debate"> 6 civilian fatalities at the hands of officers in 2012</a> that spurred protests at City Council meetings (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlpNmeafJ7Q">the most recent on May 7, 2015</a>). These incidents, though years old, were the subject of a recent <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/three-shootings-in-vallejo">long-form article published in Buzzfeed</a>, a news media company with a large national readership.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, he also worried that residents were unsatisfied with the police department’s limited resources to investigate property crimes. Since the City of Vallejo filed for bankruptcy in 2009, police staffing levels lowered and property crimes rose. <a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20150110/vallejo-neighborhood-takes-stand-against-crime">Communities have become increasingly organized through neighborhood watch organizations</a> to address needs for safety that the City has been unable to meet. The landscape into which we entered was complex in that there were may reasons for distrust in Vallejo.

                <p>Our city partner suggested that we might be able to work toward this goal by involving clergy, youth, and neighborhood watch group members in our process. He also expressed a desire for improved internal processes, proactive engagement, and data analytics.</p>

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <h3>The Recent History of Vallejo</h3>

                <p>Vallejo has had a complex recent history. Notably, in 1996, the federal government shut down the Mare Island naval shipyard, which, until closure had been the largest employer in the city. One impact of the closure was a decrease in city revenue from property taxes. This financial stress on the city’s budget was complicated by a period of high turnover of city managers. The U.S. financial crisis amplified the city’s budgetary problems, and the city filed for bankruptcy in 2008.</p>

                <p>The bankruptcy had a profound impact on the city’s ability to provide services to residents, the affects of which continue to be felt today, despite the city having been released from bankrupcty in 2011. The police department, for example, was forced to but staffing levels by about 40%; currently, the department is still about 40 sworn officers less than pre-bankruptcy levels. Beginning shortly after the bankruptcy, the city experienced a period of increased violent crime, which, understandly, many saw as a consequence of an understaffed police force. As example, there were four fold the number of murders in 2013 compared to 2006.</p>

                <p>Amidst this period of heightened crime, notably, Officer Jim Capoot was shot and killed in the line of duty in Novmeber 2011 while chasing a bank robbery suspect. Capoot was a 19-year veteran of the department and his death was a tragic loss for the police department. News reports suggest he was well-liked by city residents, and his death was similarly a blow to the community as well; <a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20150305/jim-capoots-influence-still-resonates-today">Capoot continues to be memorialized throughout the city</a>.</p>

                <p>The following year, 6 Vallejo residents were fatally shot by Vallejo Police Officers. The Solano County District Attorney's Office chose not to pursue indictments or criminal charges against any of the officers involved. The most recent officer involved shooting in which a civilian was killed <a href="">was in March 2015</a>. Additionally, <a href="">a group of about 50 demonstrators gathered in front of City Hall</a> on May 7, 2015 in protest against the Vallejo Police.</p>

            <section id="goals">
                <h2>Goals</h2>

                <p> We recognize that trusting relationships are built by people, not by digital tools.  We also recognize that all personal relationships suffer when there is lack of communication, understanding, and responsiveness.</p>

                <p>During our time in Vallejo, we saw many examples of ways in which the Vallejo Police Department, limited by tight resources, struggled to connect with the community in non-emergency contexts. Since February we have met with diverse members of the Vallejo community and have set up bi-weekly meetings with Vallejo Police Department management. We have also consulted with criminal justice experts and civic technologists since returning to San Francisco since so many people are talking about this topic in the national context as of late. We decided that we'd be able to make the most impact by:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>increasing public access to information regarding police protocols and police resources for citizens;</b></li>
                    <li><b>increasing efficiency in how the  police department responds to resident  calls for service; and</b></li>
                    <li><b>increasing lines of communication between police and Vallejo residents</b></li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section id="strategy">
                <h2>Strategy</h2>

                <p>There are three main components to our approach to this project: (1) community participation, (2) understanding police operations, and (3) harnessing police data early in preparation of building tools that incorporate data about 911 calls for service and police patrolling.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Community Participation</p>

                <p>“The idea of citizen participation is a little bit like eating spinach: nobody is against it in principle because it is good for you.”</p>
                <p><div align="right"> -- Sherry Arnstein, A Ladder of Citizen Participation (1969)</div align="right"></p>

                <p>The underlying principle guiding our project is community participation.  Unlike other civic technology projects that seek to streamline a narrowly defined technical issue within a particular governmental process, this project began with very personal issues and with very little technical definition. Therefore, we dedicated two months toward establishing relationships with diverse community leaders, with the idea that by doing so, we would establish pathways into diverse segments of Vallejo’s community for future participation in our project.</p>

                <p>For the past several months we have been performing community outreach and approached this with consideration of Vallejo’s diversity.  While we connected with the police department and with neighborhood watch members working to reduce crime in their neighborhoods, we also developed relationships with the Vallejo Chapter of the NAACP and the local Public Defenders office. We spoke with older residents as well as young adults that we met through local churches. We listened to home owners as well as renters residing in subsidized housing complexes.</p>

                    <figcaption>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We also examined where the voices that we heard came from geographically. There are over 200 neighborhood associations that have sprouted within the City of Vallejo - all representing distinct communities within the city. Some neighborhoods have established organizations and strong engagement, while others are newer to the process and their practices are more fluid. Still, there are communities where neighborhood watch activity has not yet been able to permeate. South Vallejo is discussed as a place where neighborhood watch and participatory budgeting activity remains low despite outreach efforts, for example. Knowing this, we looked at our own outreach efforts to learn where our most engagement came from.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/EngagementMap.png"/>
                    <figcaption>
                        By comparing our survey respondents' reported neighborhoods to available census data, we are able to identify underrepresented demographic sections from our outreach.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>By applying a mapping tool created by Code for America’s tech team to results from a survey that we distributed to residents via our identified community leaders we learned that our responses came mostly from particular neighborhoods.  This information helps us understand where we need to focus outreach efforts in the future.</p>

                <p>As Sherry Arnstein’s quote above communicates, most people believe that community participation is desirable. But in practice, “participation” can take many different forms, some of which allow for a community to voice concerns but do not provide mechanisms for feedback or change-making. We  thought a lot about what we wanted participation to look like and how we might develop tools that would support community efforts to actively shape relationships with law enforcement.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Understanding Police Operations</p>

                <p> We wanted to understand the many different circumstances in which police and residents interact. To this end, we shadowed police department staff working in various capacities to see how they do their jobs. We've ridden along with sworn police officers on patrol as well as with officers from code enforcement and the Community Services Section while they responded to quality of life matters reported by residents. We also sat with police staff at the station lobby, at the records department, in dispatch, and in evidence. We spoke with attorneys and detectives from the prosecutor's and the public defender's offices. To keep our findings consistent,  three of us used a standard form to collect relevant information from our observations.</p>

                <figure>

                </figure>

                <p class="section-lead">Harnessing Data Early</p>
                <p>Finally, we wanted to incorporate police department data into our work since the Vallejo Police Department generously gave us access to data regarding 911 calls placed by residents and activity by officers on patrol. In early March, before we had clear project ideas, Andrew began working with Greg Taylor, Vallejo's Chief Information Officer, to understand what data we would have available to work with and other technical aspects of the City's IT infrastructure that would be relevant to us.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Many Vallejo Residents Are Already Actively Trying to Transform Their City</p>
                <p class="description">We came to Vallejo knowing that neighborhood watch groups were increasingly active. After spending time in the Vallejo, we learned about many other engaged communities. Some examples include <a href="http://beniciaheraldonline.com/on-their-own-and-loving-it-artist-run-vallejo-art-walk-grows-thrives-despite-naysayers/">the active artist community,</a> passionate young adults organizing <a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20150326/peace-and-justice-forum-looks-to-create-dialogue-with-city-police">discussions about justice, </a><a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20140401/vallejo-woman-reopens-community-center-for-latino-families-vallejo">tireless organizing</a> within Vallejo's Spanish-speaking community, and <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/what-we-do/technical-assistance/vallejo/">Vallejo's Participatory Budgeting Project.</a> In a city with approximately 120,000 residents, the engaged communities that we've met are a small minorty. But still, small and active communities often spur great change and we saw momentum for civic engagement across different segments of the City's population, which was exciting.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Resident disappointment with the police department's ability to respond to property crimes</p>
                <p class="description">Some residents feel the police department cannot help them when they really need it. Anecdotes of calling the police for help and having to wait a very long time, even up to 4 or 5 hours, for them to arrive were very commonly told during our research. They acknowledge the bankruptcy and many told stories of speaking to officers who have told them that there just isn’t enough officers to respond quickly to every call. Living in higher crime areas and not feeling that they can rely on help makes residents feel desensitized and apathetic to calling the police for help at all.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>It took them 4 hours to get here. It was like they’d given up before they even started.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Lack of empathy received from officers they have interacted with</p>
                <p class="description">They feel the police officers who have direct contact with citizens do not care about them and their situations. Mentions of dispatchers and patrol officers not being sincere or endearing when they do finally respond to resident’s 911 calls were prominent during our research. In neighborhood watch meetings, often a police dispatcher would talk with attendees about why dispatchers may come off as rude when answering a 911 phone call. Residents we spoke to mentioned sometimes feeling like a burden for calling the police for help, especially when police arrive and give explanations about being understaffed and overworked.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I felt like I was a burden for even calling... like, I’m sorry my house got broken into and you had to come deal with it.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Some residents fear the police</p>
                <p class="description">Multiple residents that we spoke told us that they feel that patrol officers are unpredictable and can be a threat to the people they’re trying to help. One resident told us he would not call the police if two African American males were having a dispute because he thinks the police might make it worse and hurt someone. Citizens were also confused about how to hold a police officer accountable if something did go wrong. The lack of transparency and unpredictability in having an interaction with a police officer leads some residents to do their best to avoid any interactions with them at all.</p>
 
                <p class="section-lead">Residents want more access to information</p>
                <p class="description">During research sessions with diverse community members, everyone communicated that they wanted to learn more about when officers use force against residents. A public defender discussed during a public forum that her clients rarely file complaints against officers because they do not understand how to do so. Another public defender told us in a meeting that their public information requests are more frequently denied in Vallejo than in other Solano County cities. During our shadowing session in the police station's lobby, we saw individuals come in to ask about procedures that they could not find information about elswhere. Note that the police lobby has limited hours of operation so there are times when residents feel that they have no where to go other than to call 911.</p>

                <h3>Insights from the Police</h3>

                <p class="section-lead">The police department's new chief wants to increase community participation</p>
                <p>In our bi-weekly meetings with the chief and others in management, we hear a lot about the department's desire to work alongside community members to improve the quality of life in Vallejo. The chief created <a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20150527/vallejos-police-chief-advisory-board-introduced-to-public">a new advisory board to the police</a>, and <a href="http://www.timesheraldonline.com/general-news/20150411/vallejo-police-department-working-to-improve-community-ties">the appointed veteran officer and Vallejo resident, Brent Garrick, as a Community Engagement Officer</a>.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">The Police Department struggles with inefficient technologies when responding to crime</p>
                <p class="description">During our ride alongs with officers, all three of us independently learned that patrol officers were struggling to efficiently enter information into their record management system ("RMS") while out in the field.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/records_session.jpg"/>
                    <figcaption>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p> We thought that we might be able to identify a quick fix and scheduled a training session to learn how the RMS worked, hoping that we might understand the problem better. During this session, we asked basic questions about the process (such as, "What does this field mean?" "Why does this work that way?") and our trainers started to tell us the ways in which their system didn't serve their needs. They then showed us how residents file online complains for property crimes. The three of us left for a quick coffee break and came back to find all three of our trainers going through their online property crime reporting system and identifying problems with their system without our prompting. “Wow, people must be so frustrated with us!” one of them said.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Police are afraid that they'll face violence on the job</p>
                <p class="description">Management within the department told us numerous times that after one of their veteran officers was fataly shot in 2011 while on duty, they worry about officer safety. Officers have communicated with us that they understand there is always a possibility that something may happen to them while on the job.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Officers feel misunderstood and that the community does not appreciate what their jobs entail </p>
                <p class="description">Because they think the community doesn’t understand their situation, they often discredit  certain reports and complaints from citizens as a “lack of education” in the community. Patrol officers we spoke to mention feeling that their fellow officers are the only ones who really know what it’s like to be in their shoes, and that they wish residents were more empathetic of what they experience in the line of duty everyday. Many of the police department’s community engagement efforts have the goal of educating the community on what police can and cannot handle and getting citizens to understand what it’s like to be a police officer.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>We need to educate the community on what the police can and cannot do.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community doesn’t personally know the officers so they make assumptions about them</p>
                <p class="description">Officers were generally frustrated that they get compared to other police officers and departments who have recently gained a lot of negative national attention in the past couple years. They believe that if Vallejo community members  just spent more time with Vallejo police officers and got to see that they are not bad people, then the community would trust them more. Along with educating the public, many of the police’s community programs are focused on literally just spending time with officers and getting to know them.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Believing the community will not receive them openly, or doesn’t really want their help</p>
                <p class="description">When observing officers at community events, we noticed they often congregate together, separate from the rest of the attendees. When talking to police about their thoughts on community relationships, they mentioned feeling that certain communities and residents didn’t always want their help or that they weren’t always welcomed when they did try to reach out and give help. For example, when one police officer responded to the shooting of a 7 year old, he retold the story of feeling very discouraged when entering the neighborhood to investigate and having people shouting for the police to go home and that they didn’t want the police there because they didn’t trust them. Years of negative history in Vallejo as well as nationally make it very hard for the police and certain communities to receive each other openly and work together, even in the more dire circumstances. Consequently, some officers feel discouraged that they’ll ever be accepted or able to build relationships with the people that they want to help.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>It was like the walk of shame, having to get out and walk around a neighborhood where you feel like no one wants you there.</p>
                </blockquote>

            <section id="ideation">
                <h2>Early Ideations</h2>

                <p>We initially explored the feasibility of a tool that would allow a resident to track a 911 call and see how long they might expect to wait until an officer would arrive at their house. From the reports of frustration around wait times after calling 911 for less serious crimes in Vallejo, we thoerized that knowing how long it would take for an officer to arrive would set expectations.</p>

                <p>We spoke with several residents to gauge interest in this prototype, and we came away with two main findings. First, most indicated little desire in the ability to receive an estimated wait time. Secondly, the amount time these individuals reported having no problem waiting for was greater than the average of the department's responses to most crimes of lesser severity. These findings, coupled with the technical limitations of estimating arrival time - there are many factors that can greatly influence time to arrival - led us to focus on other prototypes.</p>

                <p>We also explored answering the followigng question: What if the community could be updated regularly with information on recently police activity and new information? From our first round of research, we identified that there is a need for more clear and transparent information in police activity that we hypothesized would increase community trust in the department because they would feel that they were more open and they know what’s going on. To test the value of this idea, we sat with residents and did a card sort with them, asking them to sort cards of police data they would find useful or interesting. Then we talked with them about how they might use this in their everyday lives.</p>

                <p>What we learned: Different people want different information depending on the community they most relate to, their goals, and their own personal experiences. We kept all the insights that we gained from this prototype and used it to inform the projects we’re moving forward with today.</p>

                <p>Finally, using various components of the police department's data, we developed a prototype to help patrol supervisors and other management personnel understand the patrol operations by way of analysis and data visualization. For example, by plotting a histogram of the arrival time to calls for service by time of day, we were able to clearly see a pronounced dip in arrivals during shift changes. We expected such a tool would have value when making strategic decisions.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/patrol_map.jpg">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>After demostrating this prototype in front of members of the police department, a main concern was that, given staffing levels, it wasn't clear the department would have the time to make use of such a tool. We recognized this as a design constraint and have since kept in mind that tools we develop for the department will need to fit into existing work flows.</p>

            <section id="projects">
                <h2>Current Projects</h2>

                <h3>The prototypes we're moving forward with</h3>
                <p><b>1. A tool to identify systemic quality of life issues in neighborhoods and mobilize residents and the police department to take action where problems start.</b></p>

                <p>While shadowing the Community Services Section(CSS) of the police department, who deal with reports of quality of life issues and nuisance properties in resident’s neighborhoods, we witnessed them spending copious amounts of time during intake. They receive about 200 calls to their voicemail inbox a week and write them down on a paper notepad in between service calls. We realized this process could be more efficiently handled through technology.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/tina.jpg"/>
                    <figcaption>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Additionally, we noticed that often they’re dealing with problems after they’ve already happened in neighborhoods, but what if we could help target the source of the problem? We’re now looking into not only making the reporting process less tedious, but also in gathering information on targeting the issues where they begin, when property owners neglect their properties and leave their houses open for causing nuisance and safety issues in neighborhoods.</p>

                <p>By providing tools that help police and residents work together to target the source of the problems, residents might feel a stronger sense of trust in the police’s ability to help them prevent problems before they happen.</p>

                <p><b>2. A tool that helps the police department stay coordinated, see where they can strategize their efforts, and send crime prevention strategies to residents whose neighborhood shows higher calls for service.</b></p>

                <p>We sat along with dispatchers in the police department many times in the past 6 months and noticed that they suffer from mapping constraints with the technology they are currently using. This makes it hard to coordinate information between patrol officers on the ground, slowing down their ability to respond to and help residents in need.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/dispatch.jpg"/>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We also have access to tons of rich data collected through the police’s RMS system, every time a residents calls in to 911 or an officer inputs information into their computer in the field. We want to use this information to help officers coordinate between each other, and analyze trends in neighborhoods where residents might be in greater need for crime prevention strategies.</p>

                <p><b>3. A tool that provides a central place for residents to go when they need to know what to do when the police may not directly be able or available to help them.</b></p>

                <p>A common theme throughout our work with Vallejo residence this year was the lack of useful information on what to do when they need help or where to go to find resources. We observed countless citizens visiting the front lobby of the police department just to ask a question and reports of residents not taking action on something that was important to them, simply because they didn’t know where to start.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/front_desk.jpg"/>
                    <figcaption>

                </figure>

                <p>We are now working on building a central place where residents can go online, ask a question, and find clear and straightforward answers to those questions. Police officers and other community members will be able to contribute to answers and keep a dialogue going about the biggest needs in the community. We want to make it a collaborative tool where the police department and the community can all work together to make sure everyone is always informed.</p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <h3>The rest of the fellowship and beyond</h3>

                <p>This report details our work in Vallejo from January until now, mid-June. We’ve lived in Vallejo, done research with residents and police, identified where distrust lies and named goals that we think can help make steps in the direction towards a better relationship between both parties, and now have three projects that we’re working to build and launch by November. Through our build, testing, and refining cycles, any one of these projects may change based on things we will continue to learn from Vallejo residents and police.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Development</p>
                <p class="description">We’ll be working on developing our projects on the web, testing it with the people who will be using it once it’s built, and refining each project based on the things we learn in these cycles. Currently, we're focusing on developing and deploying the smallest components ("minimum viable products") of each project, in order to prioritize user feedback.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">User Growth</p>
                <p class="description">We’ll be making sure the community and police know about the projects that we built and will be working with them to make sure it fits their needs and is practical to use in their everyday lives. We're currently strategizing on how to work with the large number of city residents and employees we've established relationships with in order to generate user growth. We hope to collaborate with the police department to use several of their summer community-focused gatherings as opportunities for "product laucnhes." We'll likely host similar events ourselves for the same purpose.</p>

                <p class="section-lead">Sustainability</p>
                <p class="description">It's our hope that our final products remain in use for some time beyond the end our engagement with the city. With this goal in mind, over the coming months we'll be focusing on: short development cycles and frequent iterations, doucmentation for public code repositories, and close collaboration with the City's IT staff to develop a sensible deployment strategy.</p>
