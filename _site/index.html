                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <h3>Code for America and Vallejo's mission</h3>
                <p>Our city partner expressed several concerns about strained relations between Vallejo residents and the city’s police department. On the one hand, our city partner cited a string of officer-involved shootings in 2011 and 2012 that spurred protests at City Council meetings and were the subject of a recent long-form article published in Buzzfeed, a news media company with a large national readership. On the other hand, he also worried that residents were unsatisfied with the police department’s limited resources to investigate property crimes. Since the City of Vallejo filed for bankruptcy in 2009, police staffing levels lowered and property crimes rose. Communities have become increasingly organized through neighborhood watch organizations to address needs for safety that the City has been unable to meet. </p>

                <p><b>Increase trust between the police department and the community.</b></p>

                <p>More specifically, our city partner suggested that we might be able to work toward this goal by involving clergy, youth, and neighborhood watch group members in our process. He also expressed a desire for improved internal processes, proactive engagement, and data analytics.</p>

                <h2>Strategy</h2>

                <h3>How we set out to accomplish goals</h3>
                <p>Unlike other civic technology projects that seek to streamline a narrowly defined technical issue within a particular governmental process, our project was both far more open and far more personal. Therefore, we decided to dedicate two months toward relationship building, community outreach and field research before building.  we decided that the more voices that we could incorporate into the design of this project, the greater likelihood that we would be able to meet our city partner’s objective of increasing trusting relationships between community members and law enforcement. We also realized that the only way we were going to be able to find a way to “increase trust” was by partnering with those in the police department as well as those living and working in Vallejo to hear their perspectives and witnessing their interactions first hand, on the ground.</p>

                <p>We realized that the only way we were going to be able to find a way to “increase trust” was by partnering with those in the police department as well as those living and working in Vallejo to hear their perspectives and witnessing their interactions first hand, on the ground.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>To do this, we set up shadowing sessions with the police department to get a first hand look at where residents and police have interactions everyday, when calling 911 or seeking assistance from the police department and city personnel, like Code Enforcement and the Community Services Section of the police department. </p>

                <p>We also sat with many different residents and listened to their stories detailing their experiences, relationships, and thoughts of the policing and safety in Vallejo. Many of them also expressed their perception of the national conversation on policing and community relations and how it relates to safety and justice in their city. </p>
